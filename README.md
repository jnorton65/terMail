#terMail - The Terminal Gmail Client

## Synopsis

terMail is a terminal desktop client for Gmail using OAuth2. It will run in the background, and be available for discrete commands as specified below.

It uses IMAP and SMTP to recieve and send emails.

## Example

    termail

This will list all emails from added mailboxes.

    termail compose

Will bring up the default text editor with a template.

Most actions can be performed with flags and options, allowing the program to be run within scripts, or other programs.

## Installation

As the project is in the early stages, it doesn't have any installation files yet. The best way to "install" is to clone it, and from there just use the gmail.py file as the entry point.
